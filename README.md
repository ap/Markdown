This is an attempt at preserving the development history of Gruberâ€™s Markdown.

The `master` branch contains each release of Markdown as a separate commit.

The `make-repo` script in this branch creates the contents of `master` from the collection of tarballs and Zip files on this branch.

I downloaded all the releases to which I could still find links in the archive of the Markdown mailing list, but that leaves me with a wildly incomplete set of files. If you have (or can point me to) any others, please share.
